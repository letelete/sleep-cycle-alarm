📌 **IT'S NOT STABLE VERSION YET**

* App is still under heavy development. First stable version will be available on Google Play.

Sleep Cycle Alarm is a material-designed Android app which helps waking up during a light sleep, it also is ad-free and open source under GPLv3 license. It has it's own alarm management system so the user doesn't need to care about removing already used alarms.<br/>
